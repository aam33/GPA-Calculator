# README for GPA Calculator

This is the README file for the GPA Calculator app. This project was originally created over the 2017-2018 school year as a part of the AP Computer Science Principles class. It was created in the Code Studio/App Lab using code.org; a link to its code.org version can be found [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/BDWPKEAjagQB7AJWDtLf1UuJwVKy4t_rUeput1Aa1DY). All code in this repo was exported from the App Lab on 08/13/2024. The GPA Calculator app was submitted to the College Board in 2018 as the portfolio component of the AP exam. The maximum score of 5 was returned for this AP exam. Minor updates to the GPA app were added in early 2020. The GPA Calculator app was tailored to ||Hamilton Southeastern|| High School's GPA system, which used weighting of 0.096 per honors class and 0.143 per AP or ACP (dual-credit through Indiana University) course. See the source code for the exact formula used to calculate unweighted and weighted GPA.
